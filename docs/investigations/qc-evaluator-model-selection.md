# QC evaluator model selection

> Moved from DragonHierOverLlm on 2026-10-09 (workstream B4 of the QC gold-set migration plan (completed 2026-10-10; see git history for `docs/plans/qc-goldset-regression-migration.md`)). The gold set and the QC and translation assessments now run from `FanslationStudio.LlmKit.Assessments`; the text below is the record as written, so `Files/Config.yaml` assessment keys and `Files/TestResults/` paths refer to the old Dragon Heir layout.

## Summary

Twenty-five rounds of testing (2026-09-20, one long session) answered three separable questions
about the post-translation QC pass (`QualityControlWorkflow`, `FanslationStudio.LlmKit`):

1. **Which model/quant/prompt combination detects genuine translation defects best?**
   `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` (`hf.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-IQ4_XS`), after maxing out the shared
   `BaseQualityControlPrompt.txt`.
2. **Do the five-call design's two "doubled" process variants (doubled detection, doubled
   verification) actually earn their extra LLM-call cost?** Doubled detection: yes, keep it (thin but
   real recall lift). Doubled verification: no measurable benefit - a targeted prompt fix did what
   doubling couldn't.
3. **Could a faster/cheaper model take over correction generation (call 3) while `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS`
   stays the detector, to save latency on the corpus's flagged subset?** No - rejected on both safety
   grounds (every cheaper candidate produces meaningfully more harmful corrections) and a hardware
   constraint (model-swapping on this box costs 11-15 seconds per switch, which rules out any
   per-row cross-model design regardless of quality).

The gold set used throughout (`FanslationStudio.LlmKit.Assessments/Files/GoldSets/ChineseToEnglishWuxia.yaml`) grew from 36 to 108 entries (102
detection items + 6 correction samples) over the course of this work and was user-confirmed
sufficient - see "Gold set growth" below.

## Method

`QualityControlAssessmentWorkflow` (`FanslationStudio.LlmKit`) runs each candidate model against
the committed gold set and records parse success, Pass/Defect/Abstain accuracy, per-category
recall/precision, correction safety, and latency, without ever mutating `Files/Converted`. A fixed
excluded-methodology (`Scripts/qc_excluded_methodology.py`) drops seam-shaped separator/newline gold
rows from the recall/precision denominator throughout - see "Separator/newline defects are out of
scope" below.

Two extensions were built specifically to answer question 3, both gated behind
`qualityControlAssessment` config keys that default to off/empty and never affect the production
`RunAsync`/`RunBruteForce` path:

- **`correctorModelNames`/`judgeModelName`**: has each named corrector candidate draft a *fresh*
  correction (`GenerateCorrectionAsync`) for every gold row with known confirmed defects - never
  reusing the gold set's human-authored correction, which exists to test verification, not
  generation - then scores it for safety with a separate, trusted judge model
  (`GetVerificationVerdictAsync`). A model never grades its own draft.
- **`enableRepairLoop`**: when a judge rejects a draft, sends it back through the *same* corrector's
  `GetCorrectionRepairAsync`, then re-verifies, up to `qualityControl.maxScoreRepairIterations` (2)
  times - mirroring production's calls 4/5 loop, to measure whether repair actually rescues a weaker
  corrector's higher failure rate rather than assuming it does.

Both write to their own subdirectories under `Files/TestResults/QcAssessment/` so
single-shot and repair-loop numbers are never conflated, and both are always run as full phases (one
model resident at a time for the *whole* batch) rather than interleaved per row - see "Model-swap
cost" below for why that matters.

## Detection: model, quant, and prompt (rounds 1-21, condensed)

- The shared `BaseQualityControlPrompt.txt` (`Qwen38`/`HyMT2`/`HyMT2Moe` families) was iteratively
  fixed for real, confirmed false-positive/false-negative patterns: placeholder/null-value leaks,
  name-as-gloss mistranslation, an invented-synonym-pair over-translation pattern, and (last)
  cross-entry mechanical consistency within a translation (number/label order, internal
  capitalization) - each verified fresh (cache deleted, re-run, before/after compared) per
  `QualityControlAssessmentWorkflow`'s caching trap (see "Gotchas" below).
- **Capability ceiling, not a prompt problem:** `HyMT2-30B-A3B` (and its quantized siblings) and
  `QwenQc-14B` (`qwen2.5:14b-instruct`) were each tested as detector candidates. Two independent,
  targeted prompt-tuning rounds each showed `HyMT2-30B-A3B` picking up nothing on hard
  semantic-reasoning categories (name-as-gloss, invented-synonym-pair) while `Qwen38Qc` improved on
  both - real evidence the gap is capability, not wording. `QwenQc-14B` additionally had a standalone
  precision bug (flagging `GARBLED_NUMBER` on short stat-label strings purely because a number was
  present) and was only 27% faster - not worth chasing. All were dropped from routine detection
  rounds; their `models:` definitions were kept for the correction-generation work in question 3.
- **Sub-question closed (2026-09-20): the HyMT2 gap is not English-instruction-following.** Both
  prompt-tuning rounds above only ever tested `HyMT2-30B-A3B` against the shared, English-language
  `BaseQualityControlPrompt.txt` - never checked against a Chinese-language prompt, despite HyMT2
  being a Chinese-origin model. Translated the prompt's full instructions/rules into Chinese
  (`Files/HyMT2ZhPrompts/BaseQualityControlPrompt.txt`, wired in via `customPromptsPath` as
  `HyMT2-30B-A3B-ZhPrompt`), keeping every structural/output-format marker unchanged (`SOURCE`,
  `TRANSLATION`, the `DEFECTS:` line, all category constants, and every placeholder/example token),
  and re-ran both a fresh English-prompt `HyMT2-30B-A3B` baseline (the previously-recorded one had a
  stale gold-set fingerprint from before the set grew to 108 entries) and the new Chinese-prompt
  variant against the current full gold set:

  | Model | `mistranslation` recall | Overall recall | Overall precision |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `HyMT2-30B-A3B` (English prompt) | 0.700 (7/10) | 0.681 (47/69) | 0.770 (47/61) |
  | `HyMT2-30B-A3B` (Chinese prompt) | 0.600 (6/10) | 0.696 (48/69) | 0.762 (48/63) |
  | `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` (tuned, reference) | 1.000 (10/10) | 0.855 (59/69) | 0.894 (59/66) |

  The two specific rows originally cited as evidence of the ceiling - `sampleId 083e1b05b5abaa3b`
  (invented-synonym-pair, "Sect Rank/Position" for a source that names one concept) and `sampleId
  b4c303b678cbd79d` (name-as-gloss, "White Cloud" for 白云子) - were missed identically under both
  prompts (`actualLabel: Pass` against `expectedLabel: Defect` in both `Results.yaml`s, byte-for-byte
  the same miss). `mistranslation`-category recall moved backward, not forward (0.700 -> 0.600), and
  overall recall/precision stayed within noise of the English baseline. **Confirmed: this is a
  genuine capability ceiling, not an English-instruction-following gap** - no further work justified
  chasing a Chinese-prompt variant for HyMT2 as a QC judge. (One row in the Chinese-prompt run failed
  to parse - `DEFECTS: OTHER_NAMED_DEFECT, UNCERTAIN`, violating the prompt's own
  never-combine-UNCERTAIN-with-a-named-category rule - a second, independent instruction-following
  miss under the translated prompt, not counted as evidence either way since it was skipped rather
  than scored.) The Chinese prompt file and `HyMT2-30B-A3B-ZhPrompt` model definition are kept in
  the repo as the investigation record; `qualityControlAssessment.modelNames` reverts to just
  `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` now that the question is closed.
- **Sub-question closed (2026-09-20): the ceiling is not a reasoning-budget problem either.** Using
  the newly-added `qualityControlAssessment.detectionThinkingEnabled` flag (mirrors the
  verification-call thinking precedent - see `FanslationStudio.LlmKit/docs/features/translation-pipeline/quality-control-pass.md`'s "Verification-
  call thinking" section) plus headroom raised in `HyMT2Moe`'s preset (`num_ctx`/`num_predict`
  4096/2048 -> 8192/4096, harmless with thinking off), ran `HyMT2-30B-A3B` with detection-time
  thinking enabled against the same 108-entry gold set (English prompt):

  | Model | `mistranslation` recall | Overall recall | Overall precision |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `HyMT2-30B-A3B` (English, no thinking) | 0.700 (7/10) | 0.681 (47/69) | 0.770 (47/61) |
  | `HyMT2-30B-A3B` (English, thinking enabled) | 0.800 (8/10) | 0.681 (47/69) | 0.810 (47/58) |
  | `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` (tuned, reference) | 1.000 (10/10) | 0.855 (59/69) | 0.894 (59/66) |

  Thinking budget picked up one different `mistranslation` row somewhere else in the set (precision
  improved too - 3 fewer false positives) but **the same two ceiling rows from the prompt-language
  sub-test above** (`083e1b05b5abaa3b` invented-synonym-pair, `b4c303b678cbd79d` name-as-gloss) were
  missed identically (`actualLabel: Pass` against `expectedLabel: Defect` in both) - a third
  independent lever (language, then reasoning budget) moved other rows but never these two. Overall
  recall stayed exactly flat (0.681, same 47/69). **Confirmed again: this is a genuine capability
  ceiling specific to these two semantic-reasoning patterns, not a budget or language artifact** -
  closes the loop on all three plausible non-capability explanations. (One transient failure hit
  during this round: a `FileNotFoundException` on `WriteYamlAtomically`'s `File.Move` - not the
  already-hardened `UnauthorizedAccessException` case, but a related concurrent-writer race where a
  second in-flight `maxConcurrency: 2` worker's retry loop never regenerates the `.tmp` file another
  worker already consumed; re-running the assessment succeeded cleanly. Worth hardening
  `WriteYamlAtomically` against this race specifically if it recurs, but not chased further here
  since a clean re-run was sufficient to get a valid result.) `qualityControlAssessment.modelNames`
  reverts to `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` and `detectionThinkingEnabled` reverts to `false`, per this sub-test's
  own scoping comment.
- **Final quant sweep (Twenty-first round), full 108-entry gold set:**

  | Model | Quant | Recall | Precision | Avg latency |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `Qwen38Qc` | `UD-Q3_K_XL` (old default) | 0.812 (56/69) | 0.875 (56/64) | 929ms |
  | **`Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS`** | `UD-IQ4_XS` | **0.855 (59/69)** | **0.894 (59/66)** | 1268ms |
  | `Qwen38Qc-UDQ4KM` | `UD-Q4_K_M` | 0.884 (61/69) | 0.871 (61/70) | 1986ms |

  `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` strictly beats the old default on both recall and precision at a bounded +36%
  latency cost (~3.6 vs ~2.7 estimated full-corpus days); `UDQ4KM`'s further recall gain costs
  precision and ~2x the latency - the wrong tradeoff direction for this pipeline's stated priority
  (a missed defect ships silently forever; a false positive costs one bounded correction round-trip).
  **User picked `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS`** as the balanced option - this is the current
  `qualityControl.modelName`.
- Two categories remain weak by design, not by omission: `formatting` (a narrow, diagnosed
  stray-whitespace pattern judged cosmetic) and `terminology` (has a working deterministic
  glossary-resync backstop, `TranslateLinesBruteForce`/`RunBruteForce`, independent of the QC LLM's
  own labeling skill - not yet run, declined by the user).

## Prompt revisions after model selection (2026-09-26)

Two later detection-prompt changes had been validated only against the raw `Comparison.yaml`
aggregate, which includes the out-of-scope separator rows. They were re-measured like-for-like:
- the morning "mass prompt tidy" (`7a70a37`), which added `MEANING_REVERSAL`;
- the `UNNATURAL_PHRASING` + pinyin-direction change (`45014ec`).

**Method.** Each prompt version was run on the current 214-pair gold set with
`qualityControl.detectionTemperature: 0`, so every run is deterministic. Two back-to-back identical
runs gave 0 label changes. Runs were scored with `Scripts/qc_compare_runs.py --heldout-rev 25d1dab`.
"Held-out" means the 198 pairs whose labels predate these prompt changes, which is the fair
regression check. "New" means the 16 pairs added alongside the `UNNATURAL_PHRASING` work.

| Prompt | Held-out recall | Held-out precision | Held-out FP | New recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 `476cef1` (twenty-first-round prompt) | 0.841 (58/69) | 0.935 | 4 | 0.727 (8/11) |
| P2 `7a70a37` (+ `MEANING_REVERSAL`) | 0.826 (57/69) | 0.905 | 6 | 0.727 (8/11) |
| P3 `45014ec` (+ `UNNATURAL_PHRASING`) | 0.826 (57/69) | 0.877 | 8 | 1.000 (11/11) |
| P5 (superseded by P7 below) | 0.812 (56/69) | 0.918 | 5 | 1.000 (11/11) |

**The regressions were real.** P2 and P3 each added false positives on the held-out set. The new
category's wins on the 16 new pairs came from examples written alongside the prompt change, so they
aren't independent evidence.

**P5 changes, each aimed at one diagnosed false-positive mode:**
- `MEANING_REVERSAL` now requires naming both parties and how their roles swapped. A barked order or
  taunt at one's own men, with a different tone or word choice, had been flagged as a reversal.
- A transliterated name with an English title (白云子 as "Master Baiyun") is explicitly correct. P3's
  "should have stayed in Pinyin" wording had started flagging it as a gloss.
- A narrow `DO NOT flag` carve-out covers emphatic particles (给我/好你个/啊/呢/吧). A first,
  broader wording (P4) made the model shy of `DROPPED_CONTENT` in general, and it missed a dropped
  `;GiveNpcAskItem` segment, so P5 states that the carve-out covers only particles.

**Stopped at P5: the noise floor was reached.** P4 and P5 score identically, and each further edit
swapped one borderline case for another. For example, P5 lost `b9d957093153803a`, a 姜婉 → "he"
pronoun error that every prompt had only ever caught under the wrong category. Remaining held-out
gaps against P1:
- `8c1504d4fd25c3fa` (蜈蚣 "centipede" rendered as "Scorpion") has been missed since P2.
- `b9d957093153803a`, above.
- `aab16c938a1c887d` (杀鸡儆猴) is a new `LOST_IDIOM` false positive.

**Gold-set label corrections (applied the same day).** Re-checking the disputed rows against the
Chinese turned up two wrong labels:
- `769a819fd026698a` `Corrected` is now a **Defect** (`fluency`). It was mined as a pronoun-only
  fix and labeled Pass for that reason, but its English is still broken: "Seeing ... injuries
  severe" has no main clause, and "in her mouth" is a word-for-word rendering of 口中.
- `e6ea2511cf64db7a` `HyMT2-7B` is now a **Defect** (`mistranslation`). 薄暮空潭曲 is half a line
  of Wang Wei's 过香积寺, where 曲 means the *bend* of the pool. So "Melody by the Dusk-Lit Pond" is
  the mistranslation, and Qwen25's "...Empty Pool Curve" (curve = bend) stays Pass.
- Two review notes were corrected: `b9d957093153803a` (its 她 refers to the other girl, not to
  姜婉) and `8c1504d4fd25c3fa` (a garbled character).

**Concrete-noun blind spot (P6 and P7).** `8c1504d4fd25c3fa` (三尸蜈蚣爪, "Scorpion" for
centipede) turned out to be shipping in the mod with `qcStatus: Passed`. A scan of short
martial-arts names in `Files/Converted` found the same class repeatedly passed by QC:
- a concrete noun swapped for a different one (蜈蚣 as "Earthworm");
- one dropped (千蛛万毒手 with no spiders, 引蛇术 as "Lure Technique");
- one invented (灵蛇拳 as "Dragon Serpent Fist").

A glossary entry was deliberately **not** added. It would fix one line and hide the QC gap, and the
evaluator injects glossary matches into gold-set prompts, so it would also hand the model the
answer.

Instead, 11 items went into the gold set (`sampleRun: ConvertedCorpus-20260926-concrete-noun-mining`)
*before* the prompt change, and the current prompt was baselined on them. That gave 7 Defect
items, 玉蜂针 as an Original/Corrected pair, and 4 Pass controls using the same creatures. The
current prompt caught **1 of the 8** concrete-noun defects.

The fix was a rule that every concrete thing in a skill/item/weapon name must appear in TRANSLATION
as that same thing: swaps and inventions are `DOMAIN_TERM`, drops are `DROPPED_CONTENT`. Its
examples are deliberately not gold-set items.
- **P6** (the rule alone) reached 4/8, but reintroduced the "Master Baiyun" false positive and
  passed a blatant prompt leak (`c61cdad79df4c969`, "No valid alternatives existed; output only the
  properly translated English text."). The prompt never had an explicit leaked-instructions rule;
  the model had been catching leaks only incidentally, under `OTHER_NAMED_DEFECT`.
- **P7** (current) scopes the rule to skill/item/weapon names and adds an explicit
  leaked-translator-output rule.

Scored against the corrected gold set (`qc_compare_runs.py` rescored every run against current
labels):

| Prompt | Held-out recall | Held-out precision | Held-out FP | Concrete-noun defects caught |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 `476cef1` | 0.817 (58/71) | 0.935 | 4 | not run |
| P3 `45014ec` (committed) | 0.817 (58/71) | 0.892 | 7 | not run |
| P5 | 0.803 (57/71) | 0.934 | 4 | 1/8 |
| **P7 (current)** | **0.817 (58/71)** | **0.935** | **4** | **4/8** |

P7 ties the twenty-first-round prompt exactly on the held-out set, keeps `UNNATURAL_PHRASING`, and
catches half the concrete-noun class, with all 4 Pass controls still passing. Still missed:
- 引蛇术 ("Lure Technique", snake dropped);
- 指虎 ("Monkey glove" for a knuckle-duster);
- 灵蛇拳 (invented "Dragon");
- 青蜂钉 ("Poison" for the colour 青).

Its one held-out loss against P5 is `06d3cc1dfc09653f` ("Deadly intent: 0.1", a colon inserted
where SOURCE has none).

## Process variants: doubled detection and doubled verification (rounds 10-13)

The five-call design (`GetLlmVerdictAsync`) runs detection twice (calls 1+2, merged permissively -
either call's finding is kept) unconditionally on every corpus column, and can run verification
twice (call 4, merged strictly - either call's objection rejects the correction) on the smaller
confirmed-defect subset. Both costs were previously assumed necessary, never measured in isolation.

- **Doubled detection: kept initially, then switched off for throughput (2026-09-20).** A clean
  single-vs-double comparison (repairing a latency-contamination bug where scoring detection alone
  had been silently triggering calls 3-5) found a real, if thin, recall lift: exactly 1 of 18
  in-scope defect rows was caught by the merge but missed by call 1 alone, 0 rows regressed
  (`QcDetectionResult.Merge` is a set union, so doubling can only match or exceed a single call's
  catch rate). At the time this measured ~1.83x the latency (927ms vs 506ms, on the then-default
  `Qwen38Qc` quant) for a lift that's small but never negative, and given a missed defect is the
  worse failure, it was kept as the production-matching default.

  Once the HyMT2 capability-ceiling sub-tests above closed off the "swap to a faster/smaller
  detector model" family of speed options, doubled detection became the largest remaining lever:
  re-measured directly against the current production quant (`Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS`), single detection
  averages 601ms/row vs 1268ms/row doubled (2.11x, not 1.83x - the earlier ratio was quant-specific)
  - roughly **15 hours across the full ~81,000-split corpus** for that same 1/18-row recall lift.
  With speed now the priority, production added a real (non-assessment-only) toggle,
  `QualityControlConfig.DoubledDetectionEnabled` (default `true`, mirrors the assessment harness's
  `doubledDetection` knob but gates `GetLlmVerdictAsync`'s own call 2, not just the evaluator),
  and set `qualityControl.doubledDetectionEnabled: false` in `Files/Config.yaml`. Revisit if a missed
  defect turns out to matter more than the ~15h saved.
- **Doubled verification: no benefit, root-caused and fixed differently.** Both harmful-correction
  gold examples known at the time scored `Safe` identically whether verification ran once or
  twice - the second independent call made the *exact same mistake*, not a different one. This
  pointed at a concrete gap (nothing in the verification prompt explicitly checked
  placeholder-token-count preservation or flagged fabricated named entities), not call-to-call noise.
  Adding those two explicit checks to `BaseQualityControlVerificationPrompt.txt` caught both examples
  correctly with a single verification call. `doubledVerification` remains a harness knob (kept at
  its production-matching `true` default) for re-testing against a larger harmful-correction sample,
  not because doubling itself is currently believed to help.

## Fast-corrector-model-swap: tested and rejected (rounds 22-25)

Full detail: `FanslationStudio.LlmKit/docs/investigations/quality-control-postmortems.md` has the
generalizable model/hardware findings; this section is the DragonHierOverLlm-specific decision.

**Finding 1 - model-swap cost rules out per-row interleaving on its own.** Measured directly against
Ollama's `/api/chat` (`load_duration` field, no LlmKit code needed): a forced model switch on this
single 16.3GB-VRAM card costs **~11.4-13.0s (`Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS`)**, **~14.9-15.2s (`HyMT2-30B-A3B`)**,
or **~6.1-6.7s (`HyMT2-7B`)** - identical whether cold-starting or repeatedly alternating (no partial
residency benefit; the card holds only one of these models at a time). Real inference is 15-300ms -
the swap tax is 40-1000x everything else. At the corpus's ~51.6% historical correction rate (~41,900
of 81,165 splits), one swap-out-and-back per corrected row would cost an estimated ~13 days of pure
reload thrashing alone. **Any pipeline that mixes resident models must batch by phase** (detect the
whole corpus, then correct the flagged subset in one resident pass, then rescore in one resident
pass, repeat per repair iteration) - never implemented in production, since the questions below
never needed it.

**Finding 2 - every cheaper corrector candidate fails on safety before speed matters.** Drafted fresh
corrections for 104 gold rows with confirmed defects, scored by `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` as an independent
judge (never grading its own draft):

| Corrector | Safe rate (65 in-scope rows, excludes formatting/separator categories) | Judge |
|---|---|---|
| `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` (single-shot) | 0.831 | itself - self-judged, **optimistic upper bound only** |
| `QwenQc-14B` (single-shot) | 0.708 | `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` - independent |
| `HyMT2-30B-A3B` (single-shot) | 0.554 | `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` - independent |
| `HyMT2-7B` (single-shot) | 0.585 | `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` - independent |
| `QwenQc-14B` + its own repair loop (up to 2 rounds) | **0.754 (final)**, 0.631 initial | `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` - independent |

Both HyMT2 variants were rejected outright (~42-45% harmful even excluding out-of-scope categories,
including 100% harmful on `dropped-content` for `HyMT2-7B` and 83% on `garbled-number` for
`HyMT2-30B-A3B`). `QwenQc-14B` is the closest real competitor - genuinely independently judged,
unlike Qwen38Qc's own self-graded number - and its repair loop *does* help (+12.3pp), but only
rescues 8 of 22 (36.4%) initially-rejected drafts; the rest ship flagged for human review exactly as
the pipeline intends. Its total measured cost (1 draft + up to 2 repairs, judge verification
cumulative) is ~2385ms/row for a **75.4%** final safe rate, versus `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS`'s un-repaired
~2751ms/row for an **83.1% (self-judged, likely overstated)** safe rate - genuinely cheaper per row,
but for a real, measurable safety gap. Given this pipeline's established priority (a missed or
harmful correction is worse than bounded extra latency), **not worth taking**.

**Final decision (2026-09-20, user-confirmed): `Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` is the single model for every QC
role** - detection, verification, correction generation, and repair. No cross-model process variant
is in production. `Files/Config.yaml`'s `qualityControl.modelName: Qwen38Qc-IQ4XS` already reflected
this (production has always used one model for every call in `GetLlmVerdictAsync`) - the
`qualityControlAssessment.correctorModelNames`/`judgeModelName`/`enableRepairLoop` keys used to
answer this question are assessment-only, never read by the production path, and have been removed
from `Files/Config.yaml` now that the question is closed (this document is the record; re-derive the
config shape from the git history of this file if the question is ever reopened).

## Gotchas found along the way

- **Caching trap:** `QualityControlAssessmentWorkflow` caches each model's `Results.yaml` keyed
  only on the gold-set fingerprint, not on prompt/config content. Changing a prompt or a new
  `correctorModelNames`/`judgeModelName`/`enableRepairLoop` combination and re-running without
  deleting the relevant output directory silently returns stale results. Always delete
  `Files/TestResults/QcAssessment/<model>/` (or the `CorrectionGeneration*` subdirectories)
  before a round meant to test a change.
- **Repair-loop resumability bug (found and fixed 2026-09-20):** the first implementation tracked
  "which rows still need fixing" in an in-memory dictionary rebuilt fresh on every call. A transient
  Windows file-lock error (see below) interrupted a run mid-repair-loop; on retry, rows already
  marked `Harmful` from before the interruption were silently skipped by the resumed run's repair
  loop (it only re-verifies rows with no verdict yet), so they never got repaired. Fixed by
  persisting `UnresolvedDefectCategories` on the result itself instead of a local dictionary, so
  resume state is always reconstructed from `Results.yaml` alone regardless of where a run stops.
- **Transient Windows file-lock on `WriteYamlAtomically`:** hit a real, repeated
  `UnauthorizedAccessException` on `File.Move` during these long, many-write runs (likely
  antivirus/indexer briefly opening the just-written file). `WriteYamlAtomically` now retries up to 5
  times with linear backoff before giving up - a small, generally-useful hardening, not specific to
  this investigation.
- **Separator/newline defects are out of scope:** `\n`/line-separator omission no longer counts as a
  QC defect since game control now wraps text - `omitted-separator`, `literal-newline`, and
  `misplaced-separator` gold categories (plus `formatting`, which overlaps heavily) are excluded from
  every recall/precision/safety denominator in this document and in
  `Scripts/qc_excluded_methodology.py`.
- **Gold set growth:** grew from 36 to 108 entries (102 detection + 6 correction samples) via several
  targeted mining passes (pronoun-attribution, multi-placeholder, harmful-correction examples mined
  from real production `qcStatus: Corrected` rows, terminology/garbled-number/prompt-leak). User
  confirmed 108 is sufficient - well under the original 300-500 stretch target - and gold-set growth
  is closed out for this cycle.
