## Summary

`QcQualityScore` (0-100, self-rated by the QC LLM in `QualityControlWorkflow`, model
`qwen38-27B-2048-unsloth` via Ollama) does not reliably distinguish genuine translation defects
from fine translations. Real sampling shows a 75-91% false-positive rate among lines flagged by
`FlaggedForQcReview` (score below `Config.yaml`'s `qualityControl.minAcceptableScore`, currently 70),
and the same source line scores wildly differently across independent re-runs with unchanged
prompt/input (e.g. one recurring passage scored 0, 5, and 10 in three separate runs; another scored
15, 15, and 35). This points to noise inherent in the model's confidence estimation, not a
prompt-wording problem — three structurally distinct prompt fixes (see below) improved specific
false-positive patterns but did not move the aggregate false-positive rate.

Out of ~50,000 QC'd lines, roughly 5,000 (10%) are currently flagged — too many to hand-validate.

## Prompt fixes already applied (real, confirmed improvements)

All three per-model-family QC prompts (`BaseFiles/Qwen38`, `Qwen25`, `Glm4` /
`Prompts/BaseQualityControlPrompt.txt`) were updated to fix specific, confirmed false-positive
patterns:

1. **Short-form floor rule** — short interjections/onomatopoeia/battle shouts/single-line dialogue
   fragments (roughly under 15 SOURCE characters) were being scored low with "I can't independently
   verify this" as the only justification. Added an explicit floor: default these to 80+ unless a
   specific named defect applies.
2. **Seam-defect clarification** — terse enumerated/list-style constructions (category tags stacked
   before a shared noun, mixing verb/noun-like items) were flagged as "broken flow at seams" when
   the actual issue was just that a more fluent rewrite was possible. Clarified that this register
   is normal for UI/condition text and a stylistic preference is not a defect.
3. **Honorific-hallucination guard** — a rule added by another session (restore a title/honorific
   dropped next to a name placeholder) was causing the model to *insert* a title (e.g. "Young
   Hero") where SOURCE had no honorific at all next to the placeholder. Added an explicit guard:
   only restore a title literally present in SOURCE; never insert one that isn't there.
4. **DEFECT-first restructuring** — reordered the output format so the model must first name one
   of a fixed set of DEFECT categories (`GARBLED_NUMBER`, `DOMAIN_TERM`, `LOST_IDIOM`,
   `UNTRANSLATED_PINYIN`, `DROPPED_CONTENT`, `HARD_TO_PARSE_SEAM`, `OTHER_NAMED_DEFECT`, or `NONE`)
   before scoring, with a CONSISTENCY rule mechanically binding DEFECT to SCORE (`NONE` requires
   80+, any named defect requires below 40). This makes the score distribution bimodal by
   construction and gives each flagged line a nameable category instead of just a number.

All four were validated against isolated Ollama calls (matching production model params exactly:
temperature 0.15, top_p 0.92, top_k 40, repeat_penalty 1.05, num_ctx 2048, num_predict 512,
`think: false`) before being accepted, and are live in all three prompt files.

## Findings that ruled out further prompt/config tuning

- **`minAcceptableScore` is now a moot lever for values in 1-79.** Because the CONSISTENCY rule
  forces every score into one of two bands (80+ for `NONE`, below 40 for any named defect), nothing
  lands in the 40-79 range. Moving the threshold anywhere in 1-79 flags an identical set of lines.
  The lever that actually matters is DEFECT-categorization accuracy, not the threshold value.
- **Widening the score scale (e.g. 0-1000) would not help.** The problem is not resolution/rounding
  — the model reaches genuinely different verdicts run-to-run on identical input, not the same
  verdict expressed with insufficient precision. A wider scale would just relabel the same noise
  with more digits.
- **Changing the flag trigger to "only flag if a correction was actually proposed" was rejected.**
  This would hide lines where the model detects a defect (low score) but the CONSISTENCY rule
  forces a binary choice and it emits `CORRECTED: NONE` anyway — a worse failure mode than current
  noise, which at least surfaces everything for human review.
- **Corpus-level spot fixes are out of scope for this investigation.** Individual bad lines found
  during sampling (e.g. a PlotData `殷殷……` → "Eern eern......" mistransliteration) are being
  triaged directly by the user via manual glossary entries (`Files/Glossary/HandRolled.yaml`), not
  through this prompt-tuning effort.

## Current triage options under consideration (option 2 now implemented — see below)

For the ~5,000 flagged lines, hand-validating all of them is impractical. Options discussed, in
order of expected effort-to-payoff:

1. **Multi-run consensus filter** — re-run only the flagged lines through the QC model 2-3
   additional times; keep the flag only if the DEFECT category agrees across runs (majority vote).
   Targets the proven noise pattern directly (same input, different score/category across runs).
2. **Stratify by DEFECT category** — hand-validate a random sample per category to get a real
   precision estimate for each, then auto-accept low-precision categories wholesale and only queue
   high-precision categories for human review. See the companion section below for what this
   requires.
3. **Deterministic pre-filter for mechanically-checkable categories** — `GARBLED_NUMBER` (digit
   presence/mismatch between SOURCE and TRANSLATION) and `UNTRANSLATED_PINYIN` (non-dictionary
   Latin-alphabet token detection) don't need an LLM's opinion at all; a script can check these
   directly instead of trusting the model's self-score.
4. **Second-model cross-check** — run the flagged set through a second model family's QC prompt
   (Qwen25 or Glm4, both already implemented) and keep the flag only where both models agree a
   defect exists. Independent-model agreement is a stronger precision signal than one model's
   confidence.
5. **Accept as-is / treat as informational only** — given the measured false-positive rate, it is
   defensible to stop trusting `QcQualityScore` for automated gating entirely and ship the 10% as
   flagged-but-unreviewed.

Option 2 (stratify by DEFECT category) is implemented — see "Per-category hand-validation findings
and policy (implemented)" below. Options 1/3/4/5 remain unimplemented; option 3 (deterministic
pre-filter for `GARBLED_NUMBER`/`UNTRANSLATED_PINYIN`) is worth revisiting given those two
categories' high measured precision below — a mechanical check could plausibly clear even more of
them without an LLM call at all.

## Requirements for option 2 (stratify by DEFECT category)

To turn this from a discussion into an actionable pipeline:

1. **Extract the flagged set with its DEFECT category.** `QualityControlWorkflow` currently parses
   `SCORE:`/`CORRECTED:` via `ScoreLineRegex`/`CorrectedLineRegex`; the new `DEFECT:` line (added in
   fix #4 above) is emitted by the model but not currently parsed/persisted anywhere — it needs its
   own regex and a field on the QC result record (alongside `QcQualityScore`, `QcStatus`, etc.) so
   it survives into whatever output the flagged-line export reads. Confirm where flagged-line
   records are currently written (converted `.yaml` output, per file grep in this session's
   history) and add the DEFECT value there.
2. **Backfill or re-run to get DEFECT for the existing 5,000.** The DEFECT-first prompt fix (#4)
   was applied after some/most of the current QC pass ran, so most of the 5,000 already-flagged
   lines likely don't have a DEFECT category recorded. Either re-run QC review only for the flagged
   subset (cheap — 5,000 lines, not the full corpus) to backfill DEFECT, or accept that this option
   requires that re-run as a prerequisite step.
3. **Group flagged lines by DEFECT category** and get per-category counts — this alone is useful
   triage signal even before any hand validation (e.g. if `HARD_TO_PARSE_SEAM` and
   `OTHER_NAMED_DEFECT` dominate the 5,000, that already suggests where the noise concentrates).
4. **Draw a random sample per category** (e.g. 30-40 lines each, more for the largest categories) —
   large enough to estimate precision with a usable confidence interval, small enough to hand-check
   in one sitting per category.
5. **Hand-validate each sample** against the same criteria used throughout this investigation
   (compare SOURCE, the full `qcReviewedText`/effective translation — not just one fragment's
   `translated:` — and the proposed `CORRECTED` text) and record genuine-defect vs. false-positive
   per line.
6. **Compute per-category precision** (genuine defects / sample size) and decide a policy per
   category: categories at or near 0% precision get auto-accepted (score/flag ignored entirely),
   categories with meaningfully higher precision get queued for full human review of every flagged
   line in that category (a much smaller set than 5,000 if noise is concentrated in a few
   categories, per findings above).
7. **No code changes are required to attempt step 4's sampling manually** (the DEFECT categories
   are already visible in raw QC output if inspected line-by-line); a lightweight script is only
   needed if the flagged-line export doesn't already surface DEFECT per row, which depends on
   whether step 1/2's parsing gap has been closed.

This option's main up-front cost is steps 1-2 (parsing/persisting DEFECT, and re-running QC on the
flagged subset to backfill it for lines scored before the DEFECT-first prompt was live) — after
that, it's a fixed, small hand-validation cost (a few hundred lines total across categories) rather
than validating all 5,000.

## Per-category hand-validation findings and policy (implemented)

Steps 1-4 above were completed (DEFECT parsing/persistence, flagged-subset backfill, per-category
counts, 40-line-per-category sample — see `TestResults/QcTriageSummary.yaml`/
`QcTriageByDefectCategory.yaml`). Step 5 (hand-validation) was done by reading all ~320 sampled
lines: for each, comparing `text` (SOURCE) against `qcReviewedText` (the *original*, pre-QC
translation — confirmed from `QualityControlWorkflow.cs`'s `anchor.QcReviewedText = effectiveTranslated`
assignment, set BEFORE the QC call) and `qcTranslated` (QC's *proposed correction*, set AFTER, from
`anchor.QcTranslated = correctedResult`) to judge whether a genuine defect existed and was actually
fixed, not just whether the two texts differ.

Counts below are out of `TotalFlagged: 6620` at the time of this pass (`QcTriageSummary.yaml`).

| Category | Count | Sample verdict | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HardToParseSeam` | 1,360 | Near-uniformly fine translations flagged for register/fluency preference. Almost no genuine defects in 40 samples. | **Auto-accept** |
| `DroppedContent` | 1,286 | Mostly false positives (pronoun/style tweaks), but 2-3 genuine content-restoration catches per 40 (e.g. "不愧是老夫" dropped, then correctly restored). Low precision, not zero. | **Auto-accept** |
| `Unknown` | 1,138 | Not a DEFECT category — lines whose response predates the DEFECT-first prompt or otherwise failed to parse a `DEFECT:` line. Scores cluster 60-70 (just under the 70 threshold), unlike every other category's sharply bimodal <40 scores under the CONSISTENCY rule — confirms these are pre-DEFECT-prompt responses, not a precision question. | **Not a policy category** — backfill via `ResetNonAutoAcceptedQcState` (`Unknown` is never auto-accepted) + a re-run |
| `LostIdiom` | 1,069 | Mixed: many flagged items are subjective literal-vs-idiomatic renderings of skill/move names (not really defects), a few genuine idiom-meaning-inversion catches, and **at least one case where the "fix" made a fine translation worse** (鬼门关: good idiomatic "Narrow escape" → over-literal "Gate of the Underworld"). Low precision, but a different risk than wasted review time. | **Deliberately undecided** — left off `autoAcceptDefectCategories` |
| `OtherNamedDefect` | 777 | Catch-all bucket — nearly every sample is a stylistic paraphrase with no factual difference. No consistent defect pattern. | **Auto-accept** |
| `GarbledNumber` | 396 | Moderate-high precision — genuine numeric/placeholder-integration garbles (a fully-untranslated numeral-unit string, wrong tael amounts, date-digit confusion). | **Review queue** |
| `DomainTerm` | 386 | High precision — real proper-noun/terminology fixes (五毒弟子 mistranslated as nonsense "Poisson Disciple" → correctly fixed; consistent character-name garbling across samples, e.g. Zhao Yinzong/Yanxi/Dianjian). | **Review queue** |
| `UntranslatedPinyin` | 206 | Near-100% precision — reviewed text is routinely literal raw pinyin ("xiang dang nian", "daoshan youpo", "wuqu mingge"), correction properly translates it. | **Review queue** |
| `None` | 2 | Negligible, not worth a policy. | N/A |
| `DroppedStutter` | 137 | Not part of the original 8-category sample (added to `QcDefectCategory` after the main pass, small enough to hand-check in full rather than sample). All 137 lines (136 `PlotData.csv.yaml`, 1 `HeroSpeTalkText.csv.yaml`) hand-validated directly. See below. | **Review queue** |

`DroppedStutter` full-population hand-validation (not a sample — all 137 lines read): roughly 65%
are genuine catches — the pre-QC translation dropped a SOURCE stammer (`师、师、师兄` → "senior
brother?!" with no stutter at all) and the QC correction properly restored it. ~20% are stylistic
reformatting rather than real defects — the pre-QC text already rendered the stammer as a full
separately-spoken repeat ("You, you, you......") and QC just reformatted it to a hyphenated partial
("Y-y-you"); both are valid stutter conventions, so this is the same "more fluent rewrite ≠ defect"
pattern already found for `HardToParseSeam`. The remainder split between lines miscategorized (the
real defect was a place name, a garbled number, or an idiom — unrelated to stuttering) and, more
seriously, **8 lines where QC's proposed correction was itself wrong and made the translation worse**
(inverting `撤撤撤` "retreat!" into "Charge!", replacing a correct "T-T-Taoist" with the nonsensical
"N-N-Nose", turning a translated idiom into raw pinyin, leaving `大当家` untranslated as "Da-Da
Dangjia", and a malformed `"Ye-,"` typo). Those 8 lines have been corrected directly in
`Files/Converted/PlotData.csv.yaml`: 5 reverted to `qcStatus: Passed` (no defect existed, QC's
"fix" was net-negative and discarded) and 3 kept as `qcStatus: Corrected` with a properly-fixed
`qcTranslated` (one recategorized `DroppedStutter` → `LostIdiom`, since the idiom mistranslation was
the dominant defect, not the missing stutter). Given ~65% genuine precision — well above the
near-zero categories that got blanket auto-accepted — `DroppedStutter` stays in the human-review
queue rather than joining `autoAcceptDefectCategories`; 137 lines is small enough that a full
hand-review (as done here) is more reliable than sampling.

**Implemented policy** (`Files/Config.yaml`'s `qualityControl.autoAcceptDefectCategories`):
`[HardToParseSeam, OtherNamedDefect, DroppedContent]` — auto-accepted categories total 3,423 lines
(52% of the flagged set) cleared without individual review; `GarbledNumber`/`DomainTerm`/
`UntranslatedPinyin`/`DroppedStutter` (1,125 lines, ~17%) stay in the human-review queue where the
flags are worth the time; `LostIdiom` (1,069) is intentionally left undecided; `Unknown` (1,138)
needs its own re-run via `Tests/QualityControlWorkflowTests.cs`'s `"8. Reset Non-Auto-Accepted
Quality Control State"` + `"2. RunQualityControlPass"` before it can be categorized at all. The
mechanism (`QualityControlConfig.AutoAcceptDefectCategories`, `QualityControlHelpers
.PassesQcScoreGate`, `QualityControlWorkflow.ResetNonAutoAcceptedQcState`) lives in
`FanslationStudio.LlmKit` — see its `docs/features/translation-pipeline/quality-control-pass.md`'s "DEFECT categories
and per-category policy" section.

**Re-running this process**: if `LostIdiom` (or any category) gets re-hand-validated later — a
prompt tweak, a larger sample, or just revisiting the judgment call — update
`autoAcceptDefectCategories` in `Config.yaml`, then run `"8. Reset Non-Auto-Accepted Quality Control
State"` to pull the affected rows back out of their current bucket for a fresh look on the next QC
pass.

## Two-stage DEFECT verification (root-cause fix, implemented)

The `DroppedStutter` full-population hand-validation above surfaced a failure mode none of the
earlier prompt fixes addressed: a single QC call is asked to detect a defect, name its category,
judge severity, and freehand-rewrite a correction all in one shot. That's too much for one call to
do reliably. Two distinct problems came out of the same root cause:

1. **Miscategorization** — the model reached for `DROPPED_STUTTER` just because SOURCE happened to
   contain a stammer, even when TRANSLATION already conveyed it validly (a false positive) or the
   real defect on the line was something else entirely (a wrong place name, a garbled number, a
   mistranslated idiom) — see the "~8 lines miscategorized outright" finding above.
2. **Bad corrections** — worse, when a genuine defect *was* present, the freehand rewrite meant to
   fix it sometimes broke something else in the same line: a correct "T-T-Taoist" replaced with the
   nonsensical "N-N-Nose", `撤撤撤` ("retreat!") inverted into "Charge!", a translated idiom turned
   into raw pinyin, `大当家` left untranslated as "Da-Da Dangjia" — see the "8 lines actively bad
   fixes" finding above, all found and corrected by hand in `PlotData.csv.yaml` this pass.

Prompt wording alone can't fully close this — the model conflates "detect" and "freely rewrite"
because they're asked in the same breath. The fix is architectural, not another prompt tweak: split
DEFECT detection from correction into two calls, the same pattern the main translation pipeline
already uses for its own rule-violation retries (`TranslationService.CalulateCorrectionPrompt` —
translate, validate, and only on failure issue a second, narrowly-scoped correction call rather than
trusting the first attempt to also self-diagnose and fix).

**Implemented**: `qualityControl.twoStageVerificationEnabled` (`Config.yaml`, off by default). When
on, any column the main QC call flags with a named DEFECT gets a second, narrower call
(`QualityControlWorkflow.GetVerificationVerdictAsync` in `FanslationStudio.LlmKit`) shown SOURCE, the
*original* TRANSLATION, and the single claimed DEFECT category — not asked to rediscover a defect
from scratch, only to judge that one specific claim — which responds `CONFIRMED` (keep the category,
use this call's SCORE/CORRECTED instead), `FALSE_POSITIVE` (clear the defect and raise the score —
the automated version of the manual per-category hand-validation this doc's "stratify by DEFECT
category" section describes), or a different DEFECT token (recategorize). A correction is only ever
accepted from this second, narrowly-scoped call, never from the first call's freehand rewrite — this
is what should prevent the "Cui Cui Cui" → "Charge!" class of bad fix going forward. Costs one extra
LLM call, but only for the ~10-15% of lines already flagged, not the whole corpus. Full technical
reference: `../../FanslationStudio.LlmKit/docs/features/translation-pipeline/quality-control-pass.md`'s "Two-stage
DEFECT verification" section.

Not yet done (at the time this section was written): turning this on for a full corpus run and
re-triaging `DroppedStutter` (and the other review-queue categories) against its output to see how
much it actually moved the false-positive/bad-correction rate in practice — see the next section for
that measurement.

## Re-triage under `twoStageVerificationEnabled` (2026-09)

First full-corpus run with `twoStageVerificationEnabled: true` (git history: "Another run with
TwoStageVerification"), followed by a fresh `GetQcTriageAsync` pass
(`Files/TestResults/QcTriage*.yaml`, `totalFlagged: 6165`). Re-validated by hand-checking a sample
from each category's `QcTriageByDefectCategory.yaml` entry, comparing `qcReviewedText` (pre-QC) against
`qcTranslated` (QC's proposed fix) the same way the original per-category pass did.

**`DroppedStutter` moved to `autoAcceptDefectCategories`.** The original single-stage pass found this
category ~65% genuine with 8/137 outright bad fixes (`撤撤撤` "retreat!" inverted to "Charge!", etc.),
which is exactly the failure mode two-stage verification was built to catch. In this run's ~36-line
sample (the category's full flagged set was 458), every single line was a clean, correct stutter
restoration with zero bad fixes — e.g. "Cough, cough, uh-huh, ah, well, I'll be going!" correctly
gained a dropped "g-" before "goodbye!". Moved into `Files/Config.yaml`'s `autoAcceptDefectCategories`
on the strength of this, but the sample (36) is much smaller than the original full 137-line
hand-validation, so if this category's flagged count grows sharply or a bad fix resurfaces, re-check
against a larger sample before trusting it further.

**Every other category's policy held.** `DomainTerm`/`GarbledNumber`/`UntranslatedPinyin` samples were
still high-precision, genuine catches (e.g. 泥鳅蛊 "Fish toad trap" → "Loach Gu", 太、太、and other
proper-noun/numeral fixes) — correctly still in the human-review queue.
`DroppedContent`/`HardToParseSeam`/`OtherNamedDefect` samples were still low-severity-but-legitimate
tweaks (pronoun/title restoration, garbled-seam cleanup) — correctly still auto-accepted. `LostIdiom`
stayed mixed — correctly still left undecided.

**New finding: no-op "corrections" wasting review time.** ~1.6% of the sampled flagged lines (5/319)
had `qcTranslated` byte-identical to `qcReviewedText` — the model (or the verification call) confirmed
a DEFECT category but its own freehand "fix" reproduced the original text verbatim (e.g. `霓裳仙子` →
"Fairy Nishang" → "Fairy Nishang", unchanged). These got a low score and sat in the human-review queue
for a translation that was never actually going to change. Fixed in
`FanslationStudio.LlmKit`'s `QualityControlWorkflow.ReviewColumnAsync`: a correction identical to the
already-accepted `effectiveTranslated` is now treated as `DEFECT: NONE` (score 100, `QcStatus.Passed`,
never flagged) regardless of what the model claimed, rather than kept as a "confirmed" low-score
defect with nothing behind it.

**Isolated bad-fix regression, not a pattern.** One `DomainTerm` sample had a correct pre-QC
translation ("glanced at the sun in the mountains") turned *wrong* by the "fix" ("glanced at the
Great Yang in the mountains" — 太阳 taken as a term-of-art rather than literally "the sun"). A single
instance in ~40 `DomainTerm` samples, not a repeated pattern, but a reminder that two-stage
verification reduces this failure mode, it doesn't eliminate it — `autoAcceptDefectCategories`
membership should keep depending on a category's *aggregate* precision, not an assumption that
verification makes every individual correction safe.

## Meaning-reversal miss and new `MeaningReversal` category (2026-09-26)

A user-reported line (`Files/Converted/PlotData.csv.yaml`, raw row `274,魏胥华,熊百胜,左,...`,
source `大！当！家！放我顾师弟走，饶你不死。`) surfaced a failure shape none of the categories above
actually cover. SOURCE has the speaker offering the boss mercy as a counter-threat/bargain ("Boss!
Let my junior brother go, and I'll spare your life") in exchange for releasing their junior brother.
Both the pre-QC `translated` and the QC `qcTranslated` invert this into the speaker begging for
their *own* life ("I beg you not to kill me" / "I beg you to spare my life") — every word has a
plausible-looking rendering, but who is granting mercy to whom is backwards. The QC pass filed this
as `DroppedContent` (wrong — nothing is omitted) and verification call 2 (`GetVerificationVerdictAsync`)
scored the still-broken correction 92/100, well above `minAcceptableScore` (60), so `PassesQcScoreGate`
shipped it on score alone, before `autoAcceptDefectCategories` was ever consulted.

Two compounding gaps, not one:

1. **No prompt check for this failure shape.** `BaseQualityControlVerificationPrompt.txt`'s only two
   mechanical fidelity checks are placeholder-token preservation and proper-name-exists-in-SOURCE
   (checks 2a/2b) — nothing checks whether a correction preserves *who is doing what to whom*.
   Detection's `BaseQualityControlPrompt.txt` has one generic "meaning mismatch" line but no worked
   example for agency/direction reversal, unlike the omitted-subject-inheritance case which got one
   baked into all 5 model families' prompts.
2. **No safe category even if flagged correctly.** Had this scored low, the only two categories a
   model would plausibly reach for — `DroppedContent` and `OtherNamedDefect` — are *both* on
   `autoAcceptDefectCategories`, so it would have shipped anyway regardless of score.

**Fix applied**: added `QcDefectCategory.MeaningReversal` (`FanslationStudio.LlmKit`'s
`Support/QcDefectCategory.cs` + `QcDefectCategoryTokens.cs`), deliberately never added to
`autoAcceptDefectCategories` regardless of future sample precision (see
`../../FanslationStudio.LlmKit/docs/features/translation-pipeline/quality-control-pass.md`'s "DEFECT
categories and per-category policy" section for why this one category is a deliberate exception to
the usual precision-sampling loop). Prompt files across all 5 model families updated with an
explicit agency/direction-fidelity check and a worked example using this exact case. Added as a
gold-set regression case: `FanslationStudio.LlmKit.Assessments/Files/GoldSets/ChineseToEnglishWuxia.yaml`'s `correctionSamples[]` entry
`8a1f6e0c9d723bb4`, source pinned in `Files/Config.yaml`'s `translationAssessment.pinnedSampleSources`
so it's retested on every future assessment run.

**Also found in passing**: this doc's own "Two-stage DEFECT verification" section (LlmKit's
`quality-control-pass.md`) described the feature as gated by a `twoStageVerificationEnabled` flag that
no longer exists in code — it's unconditional now. Flagged inline there rather than rewritten here.
